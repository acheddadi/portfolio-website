<h1>I'm Ali, a visual artist with a keen interest in Computer Science, 
    Mathematics and Fine Arts.</h1>
<p>I studied Digital Photographic Imaging at Concordia University's School 
    of Continuing Education in 2015 and have been actively creating digital 
    art and video games ever since. I received a BFA in Studio Arts from 
    Concordia University in 2019 and am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree 
    in Computer Science at Algoma University in Ontario.</p>
<p>During my time as a Studio Art student, I often found myself drawn to the 
    gamification of my work, gravitating towards the use of technologies such 
    as virtual reality or mechatronics.</p>
<p>I find computer science to be closely related to my art practice as I frequently 
    work with Kinetic sculptures that follow basic and rudementary patterns that 
    somehow communicate abstract ideas; this idea of following a simple sequence of 
    rules to achieve complicated tasks is one that I find very interesting.</p>
